A final keyword in java can be used with a class,
with a variable and with a method.
● final keyword restricts the further modification.
● When we use final keyword with an entity (class
or variable or method), it gets the meaning that
entity is complete and can not be modified
further.
● final is a non access modifier

We can’t create a subclass to the final class or we
can’t extend a class or we can’t modify a class
which is declared as final.
final class FinalClass {
    //some statements
}

class SubClass extends FinalClass {
    //compile time error
    //Can't create sub class to the final class
}
Final method
We can’t override a method or we can’t modify a
method in the sub class which is declared as final
in the super class.
class SuperClass {
    final void methodOne() {
        //some statements
    }
}

class SubClass extends SuperClass {
    @Override
    void methodOne() {
        //Compile time error
        //can not override final method
    }
}
Final variable
The value of a final variable can not be changed
once it got initialized.
class AnyClass {
    final int i = 10;

    void methodOne() {
        i = 20;     //compile time error
        //final field cannot be re-assigned
    }

Overriding:
    Overriding happens when same methods exists in parent and child class.
Benefits:
    we can have specific implementation for a method that is already defined in the
    Parent class. That we have this flexibility that we don't have to come up with
    different names if we are doing same thing again in the child classes.
Rules:
    1) we can change the access modifier in child class but we can make it
    only less restrictive for example we can change protected or default to public
    but we can not do the reverse.
    2) static methods have the same rules but we use a different terminology we
    say we are
    re-declaring a method instead of overriding.
    3) return types must be same in overriding.
    4)Name must be same
    5) parameters should also be same.

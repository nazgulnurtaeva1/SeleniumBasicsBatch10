Access modifiers:
Keywords that determine the access of members(fields/methods/constractors and class)
 Access Mod. has 4 access levels and 3 keywords:
 1) private ====> We can only access that member inside that same class only.
 2) default
 3) protected
 4) public



Note:
 1) we can not have two public classes inside a .java file
  2) there should be a public class with same name as of your
   file otherwise u will get an error(only in Java!   Python, C# doesn't have it)
  3) we can have many classes inside a .java file but only one public class

=======================================================================================
Constructors
   Constructors are special block of code executed when we create the object of a class
    by writing new keyword and name of class with parenthesis.
We mainly use constructor to initialize the fields of an object, but we can also put some
 code that we want to execute everytime someone is creating the object of that class.
Rules:
1) No return type not even void
2. same name as class name
3. we can have constructors with and without parameters
4. Constructors don't participate in inheritance
5. Constructors are automatically called when you create the object.
6. We can overload cons.
7. We can not use non access modifiers like static with constructors
8. we can not override a constructors because yhey don't participate in inheritance
9. if we are not creating a cons., java creates default zero argument constructor automatically.
